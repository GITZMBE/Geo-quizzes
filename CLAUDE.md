# Geo Quizzes

Interactive geography quiz web app: sign up with email/password, play
map-based quiz games, compete on per-game leaderboards. See `README.md` for
stack summary and local setup/run commands — this file covers conventions
and gotchas an agent working in this repo needs to know.

## Architecture gotchas (read before touching auth/state/data)

- **Auth is Credentials-based (email + password + bcrypt), not OAuth.**
  `POST /api/auth/register` creates the `User` row (hashed password via
  `bcryptjs` — pure JS, no native binary, same reasoning as the Prisma
  adapter below). `lib/auth.ts`'s `authorize()` looks the user up and
  compares the password. There's no email verification or password-reset
  flow — out of scope unless asked for.
- **Auth is split into two files** to keep Prisma/bcrypt out of the Edge
  runtime: `lib/auth.config.ts` is the Edge-safe base (a stub Credentials
  provider whose `authorize` is never actually called — middleware only
  verifies the JWT, it never invokes a provider) and is what `proxy.ts` uses
  directly. `lib/auth.ts` extends it with the *real* `authorize()` and the
  Prisma adapter, for use only in pages/API routes. Don't import
  `lib/auth.ts` from `proxy.ts` or anything else that runs in Edge middleware.
- **`proxy.ts`** (Next.js 16 renamed `middleware.ts` → `proxy.ts`) gates all
  page routes behind login except `/`, `/sign-in`, `/sign-up`, but its matcher
  **excludes `/api/*` entirely** — API routes return their own 401 JSON via
  each route's own `auth()` check, rather than being redirected to an HTML
  page. It also redirects already-logged-in users away from `/sign-in` and
  `/sign-up` to `/games`.
- **State management is `nanostores`, not Recoil.** Recoil was the original
  choice but turned out to be fundamentally incompatible with React 19 —
  not just an SSR/prerender issue, it crashes at runtime in the browser too
  (`useRecoilState` reaches into
  `React.__SECRET_INTERNALS_DO_NOT_USE_OR_YOU_WILL_BE_FIRED.ReactCurrentDispatcher`,
  whose shape changed in React 19, and Recoil hasn't been updated since).
  `lib/state/useGameState.ts` wraps `@nanostores/react`'s `useStore` to mirror
  `useRecoilState`'s exact `[state, setState]` shape (setState accepts a
  value or an updater function), so game components barely changed — see
  `lib/state/gameAtoms.ts` for the atom definitions. Use `useGameState` for
  any new per-component game state; there's no cross-component sharing
  currently, so plain nanostores atoms (not computed/derived stores) are
  the right level of complexity.
- **`GlobeView` (`components/GlobeView.tsx`) wraps `react-globe.gl`, not raw
  `globe.gl`.** An earlier version hand-rolled globe.gl's imperative Kapsule
  API directly (manual container ref, `new Globe(container)` in a
  `useEffect`, imperative `.polygonsData()`/`.onPointClick()`/etc. chains) and
  hit two rounds of real DOM-lifecycle crashes (`domNode.innerHTML = ""`
  throwing because the container was null/detached — confirmed both times by
  decompiling the actual crashing chunk, not guessed). `react-globe.gl` (same
  author, maintained React binding) handles all of that correctly — **pass
  layer data as props** (`polygonsData`, `pointColor`, `onPolygonClick`,
  `onGlobeClick`, etc., driven by component state/props) rather than calling
  methods imperatively on an instance. Use the forwarded `ref`
  (`useRef<GlobeMethods>(null)`) only for the couple of ref-only methods:
  `pointOfView()` and `controls()` (to set `enableRotate = false`). See
  `ClickDotMode.tsx` / `ProximityMode.tsx` for the pattern (point-based
  "guess the location" games, where a sphere is the more honest
  representation of the task). Don't reintroduce a manual globe.gl wrapper.
- **`polygonCapColor` can't have a nonzero-alpha "idle" fill on a
  many-polygon *globe* game.** three-globe's polygon cap material is
  `transparent` with `depthWrite: true` — a known bad combination once more
  than a couple of same-frame polygons use it: confirmed by bisecting an
  earlier globe-based US States prototype (50 states) that 2 simultaneously-
  tinted caps render clean but 3+ produce a hazy color wash across the
  *entire* globe, not just the polygons themselves. This is why click-a-
  region games moved to `MapView` (below) instead of chasing this further —
  if a future game ever renders many polygons on `GlobeView`, the fix is:
  return fully transparent (`"rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"`, not a low-alpha tint) for
  every "idle" polygon, and only return a real color for the handful (1-2)
  actually highlighted for correct/wrong feedback at any instant.
- **`MapView` (`components/MapView.tsx`) is a flat 2D map (d3-geo + SVG),
  used for click-a-region games instead of `GlobeView`.** Stockholm
  Districts and US States both moved off `GlobeView` to `MapView` — a flat
  projection is easier to click precisely than a rotatable sphere, and
  sidesteps globe-only problems entirely (the `polygonCapColor` bug above,
  Alaska/Hawaii camera framing, rotation-lock tradeoffs). Pass
  `regionsData`/`fill`/`stroke`/`onRegionClick`/`label` as props, same
  props-driven pattern as `GlobeView`. Gotchas specific to it:
  - **Projection choice matters more than it looks.** `"mercator"` (default)
    is fine for a single contiguous landmass. `"albersUsa"` natively insets
    Alaska/Hawaii for the US States game. `"pacific"` (Mercator rotated
    180°) exists because Oceania's own countries straddle the antimeridian
    (Fiji spans -180..180, Kiribati -171.7..174.8) — the default Mercator's
    `fitSize` bounding-box blows up to ~360° of longitude and squeezes every
    country into a sliver otherwise. Add more rotated variants here rather
    than fixing it in each game's data.
  - **A real, non-self-intersecting polygon can still render as an unfilled
    hole near the poles.** Confirmed with Canada's Ellesmere Island
    (82.5°N): `@turf/kinks` found zero self-intersections in the source
    geometry, so this is a d3-geo Mercator-at-extreme-latitude edge case,
    not a data bug — neither rewinding (`@turf/rewind`) nor
    `fillRule="evenodd"` fixed it. The data-prep-side fix is to drop any
    ring reaching past ±80° latitude (see `scripts/build-world-countries.js`'s
    `dropTinyRings`) — the same kind of threshold real web maps use (Web
    Mercator caps at ~85.05°N/S).
  - **A disproportionately large transcontinental country can dominate a
    continent map's `fitSize` bounds.** Russia's Asian extent squeezed all
    of Western/Central Europe into unclickable slivers on the Europe map —
    fixed by clipping Russia's *map* geometry to west of the Urals
    specifically (`scripts/build-world-countries.js`'s
    `clipToEuropeanRussia`); its capital/flag data is unaffected since
    those don't depend on the polygon extent.
  - **`MapView` also renders LineString/MultiLineString features (roads),
    not just Polygon/MultiPolygon** — `d3.geoPath`/`fitSize` are
    geometry-type-agnostic so this needed no change to path generation
    itself; a caller just passes `fill={() => "none"}` and the (now
    per-feature-function) `strokeWidth` prop for a visible line. Two things
    had to change to make this safe: `strokeWidth` became a
    `(feature) => number` prop (default `() => 1`, so every existing caller
    is unaffected) instead of a hardcoded `1`, since a highlighted road
    needs a thicker stroke than a clickable region's border; and
    `smallRegions` (the too-small-to-click marker logic) is now gated to
    only run on `Polygon`/`MultiPolygon` features — it used to assume every
    feature was one and would compute a nonsense degenerate-ring
    `area()`/`centroid()` off a LineString's `coordinates` otherwise. There's
    also a `markers` prop (`{lat, lng, label}[]`) for arbitrary point labels
    independent of `regionsData` — e.g. a road's two endpoint places —
    projected via the same d3 projection `pathFor` uses internally (which is
    why `pathFor`'s `useMemo` is now split into a `proj` memo and a `pathFor
    = geoPath(proj)` memo chained off it, rather than one combined memo that
    only ever exposed the wrapped `geoPath`).
- **Prisma uses `prisma-client-js` with `engineType = "client"`**, output to
  `app/generated/prisma/`. Import from `@/app/generated/prisma`, not
  `@prisma/client` directly. `lib/prisma.ts` constructs the client with
  `@prisma/adapter-neon` (connects over HTTP/WebSocket, not a direct TCP
  connection) — there is **no native query-engine binary** to bundle, which
  is what makes this work inside a Netlify Function at all. Two things that
  look like reasonable fixes but are dead ends, already tried:
  - The newer `prisma-client` TS generator doesn't implement the `adapter`
    option at all (prisma/prisma#28073).
  - Passing `{ adapter }` to `PrismaClient` with `prisma-client-js` but
    *without* `engineType = "client"` silently does nothing — it still loads
    the native library engine. Verify any future Prisma changes by removing
    the local `query_engine-windows.dll.node` and confirming queries still
    work; if they don't, the adapter isn't actually being used.
  - `prisma.config.ts` (not the `package.json` `prisma` key) drives the CLI.
- **React 19's stricter effect-rules lint** (`react-hooks/set-state-in-effect`,
  `react-hooks/refs`) will fail CI-equivalent checks if you call `setState`
  synchronously in an effect body (do it inside a `.then`/callback instead) or
  mutate a ref during render (assign it inside a `useEffect`). Run
  `npx tsc --noEmit && npm run lint` after any change.
- Score types are `POINTS` (higher is better) or `TIME_MS` (lower is better);
  `app/api/games/[slug]/leaderboard/route.ts` sorts ascending/descending
  accordingly based on the mode's `scoreType` in the registry.

## Adding a new game

Use the **`new-game` skill** (`.claude/skills/new-game/SKILL.md`) — it covers
choosing points-vs-polygons data shape, sourcing coordinates from GeoNames
without fabricating them, the two canonical JSON envelopes, registering in
`lib/games/registry.ts`, and the page-scaffolding patterns (GlobeView,
nanostores atom shape via `useGameState`, score submission, leaderboard).
Don't invent a third data shape or reimplement patterns it already
documents. The skill predates `MapView` and `useRoundGame` (see the
gotchas above and the Countries-of-`<continent>` games below) — for a new
click-a-region game, prefer `MapView` over `GlobeView` unless the game is
genuinely globe-scale/rotatable; for a new game that's really N near-
identical instances of the same round shape (e.g. one per continent/
category), prefer `useRoundGame` + a shared mode component over one-off
per-instance files.

`lib/games/registry.ts` is the single source of truth for game/mode slugs,
display names, and data file paths — both the UI and the API routes read
from it. `lib/games/data.ts` has the shared fetch helpers (`fetchRegions`/
`fetchPoints`, plus `fetchDistricts`/`fetchCities` aliases for the existing
games).

## Games implemented

1. **Stockholm Districts** (`/games/stockholm-stadsdelar`) — district named,
   click its border on the map; POINTS, one pass through all districts.
2. **Sweden's Biggest Cities** (`/games/sweden-cities`) — three modes:
   - *Type them all* — free recall of the top 100, autocomplete kicks in only
     after 5+ chars typed **and** an unambiguous match remains; TIME_MS,
     scored only on full completion (giving up doesn't submit a score).
   - *Click the city* — named city, click its dot; POINTS.
   - *Guess the location* (maptap-style) — 5 random cities, click your guess
     on the map, scored by distance via `lib/games/geo.ts`
     (`haversineDistanceKm`/`proximityScore`); POINTS.

`public/data/sweden_largest_cities.json` coordinates were sourced from the
GeoNames Sweden dump and matched programmatically (`scripts/match-city-coords.js`)
— two localities (Västerhaninge, Nordöstra Göteborg) use documented proxy
coordinates since no exact GeoNames entry exists for those SCB locality
names; see the file's `note` field.

3. **Five Cities Across the World** (`/games/world-cities`) — one mode,
   *Guess the location*: 5 random cities from the top 120 most populous
   cities worldwide, click your guess on the freely-rotatable globe; POINTS,
   scored by distance via `proximityScore(distanceKm, decayKm)` — this game
   passes a much larger `decayKm` (3000, vs. the 600 default tuned for
   Sweden's country-scale game) so a right-continent guess still earns
   partial credit at world scale.

`public/data/world_largest_cities.json` coordinates and populations come
from GeoNames' worldwide `cities15000` dump, filtered to feature class `P`
and sorted by population (`scripts/build-world-cities.js`) — no per-item
proxying needed, unlike the Sweden data.

4. **US States** (`/games/us-states`) — one mode, *Click the state*: a
   state is named, click its outline on a `MapView` using the `"albersUsa"`
   projection, which natively insets Alaska/Hawaii near the mainland;
   POINTS, one pass through all 50 states.

`public/data/us_states.json` borders come from geoBoundaries' USA ADM1
boundaries (public domain), filtered down to the 50 states (dropping DC +
5 territories that geoBoundaries includes in the same set) and simplified
(`scripts/build-us-states.js`) — both for file size (the raw simplified
release is still ~5MB, mostly Alaska/Hawaii coastline) and render
performance (Alaska alone had 586 separate island rings before dropping
ones under 0.5% of its largest ring's area).

5. **List All Countries** (`/games/world-countries`) — one mode, *Type them
   all*: free recall of all 197 sovereign countries, same autocomplete-and-
   guess pattern as Sweden's cities game; TIME_MS.
6. **Countries of Africa/Asia/Europe/North America/South America/Oceania**
   (`/games/countries-<continent>`) — each with three modes, all POINTS,
   one pass through that continent's countries:
   - *Countries* — named country, click its outline on a `MapView`
     (Oceania uses the `"pacific"` projection — see the `MapView` gotcha
     above).
   - *Capitals* — named country, type its capital.
   - *Flags* — flag shown, type the country name.

   These three modes are shared components (`components/games/
   {CountriesMapMode,CapitalsMode,FlagsMode}.tsx`) parameterized by
   `gameSlug` + country data, not one-off per-continent files — with 6
   continents × 3 modes being 18 near-identical instances of the same
   round-progression shape, that's genuinely warranted (see
   `lib/games/useRoundGame.ts`, and `getRoundState(key)` in
   `lib/state/gameAtoms.ts` for the per-instance persistent atom factory),
   unlike the one-off mode files every other game uses.

`public/data/world_countries.json` (points format) and
`public/data/countries_<continent>.json` (GeoJSON, one per continent) come
from Natural Earth's 1:50m Admin-0 country boundaries (public domain) for
borders/continent, GeoNames' `countryInfo.txt` for capitals, and
flagcdn.com for flag images (referenced by URL, not downloaded) —
`scripts/build-world-countries.js`. Natural Earth's raw set includes
dependencies/territories (Puerto Rico, Greenland, Hong Kong, etc.) and a
few disputed territories alongside real countries; the script filters
those out and documents exactly what's dropped and why in the output
file's own `note` field.

7. **Swedish Roads** (`/games/swedish-roads`) — a road's route is
   highlighted on a `MapView` (drawn together with Sweden's own outline for
   context, reused from the Europe continent game's data rather than a
   dedicated Sweden-only file), type its route/designation number; five
   modes split by road tier (all/motorways/national/county/secondary
   county), all POINTS, 5 random roads per run from that tier's pool.

`public/data/swedish_roads.json` route designations + place-list order
come from Swedish Wikipedia's road-numbering articles, actual route
geometry from OpenStreetMap via the Overpass API — both fetched live by
`scripts/build-swedish-roads-{primary,secondary}.js` (see that script's own
header for the Overpass endpoint/rate-limit/curl-not-fetch specifics also
relied on by the two games below).

8. **Guess the City** (`/games/city-streets`) — one mode, *Street
   pattern*: only a major city's street network is shown (no labels,
   borders, or coastline — the road pattern is the only clue), type which
   city it is; POINTS, 5 random cities per run from a pool of 30.

`public/data/city_streets.json` major-road geometry (motorway/trunk/
primary only, clipped to a several-km box around each city's center, then
simplified for file size) comes from OpenStreetMap via Overpass, the same
endpoint/technique as the Swedish Roads game above —
`scripts/build-city-streets.js`. The 30-city list is a deliberate curation,
not a population-rank cut: every city is unambiguously major, but was
specifically chosen for having a visually distinctive street layout (a
ring road, a radial star, a strict grid, a unique planned shape) — a raw
top-N-by-population list would include many huge but visually generic
sprawl cities indistinguishable from one another by streets alone, which
would make "recognize the city from its road pattern" unwinnable for most
of them. Coordinates are reused as-is from `world_largest_cities.json`
(no re-geocoding). See the script's header comment for the full list and
each city's distinctive feature.

9. **Higher or Lower** (`/games/higher-or-lower`) — two modes (Population,
   Area): a reference country is shown on the left with its value, a second
   country on the right with its value hidden — guess whether it's higher
   or lower; POINTS, scored as the length of the correct streak (ends on
   the first wrong guess, matching the classic "higher/lower" mechanic).
   This is the one game whose round shape doesn't fit `useRoundGame` (no
   fixed shuffled order — an open-ended streak instead), so it has its own
   state shape/factory (`HigherLowerState`/`getHigherLowerState` in
   `lib/state/gameAtoms.ts`) rather than reusing `RoundGameState`.

`public/data/country_stats.json` population + area (km²) come from
GeoNames' `countryInfo.txt`, cross-referenced by ISO alpha-2 against the
existing 197-country list in `world_countries.json` (id/name/lat/lng/
flagUrl reused from there rather than re-derived) —
`scripts/build-country-stats.js`. Kept as its own data file rather than
adding population/area fields onto `world_countries.json` itself, so as
not to risk the 6 continent games that already depend on that file's exact
shape.

## Infra / deployment status

- **GitHub**: `https://github.com/GITZMBE/Geo-quizzes.git` (repo has been
  renamed twice — `Geo-quiz` → `Geo-quizes` → `Geo-quizzes`; local folder and
  all in-repo references renamed to match each time — `geo-quizzes` is the
  canonical slug used in `package.json`, Docker Postgres credentials, etc.)
- **Database**: Neon Postgres, project `geo-quizzes` (id
  `patient-shape-66081015`, region `aws-eu-central-1` — id and connection
  hostname are stable across the project's display-name renames). Connection
  string is in the local `.env` only (never committed). Initial migration has
  been applied directly against it.
- **Netlify**: site `geo-quizzes` (account `gitzmbe`) is linked to
  `GITZMBE/Geo-quizzes` on branch `master` for continuous deployment (reusing
  the account's existing GitHub App installation — linked via the Netlify API
  since local `netlify deploy` can't work on Windows: the Next.js plugin's
  packaging step needs symlinks, which are unprivileged-blocked on Windows).
  `DATABASE_URL`, `AUTH_SECRET`, `NEXTAUTH_URL` are set as env vars.
  `netlify.toml` build command runs `prisma migrate deploy && prisma generate`
  before `next build`, so schema migrations apply automatically each deploy.
  **Verified live and working** (`/api/games/*/leaderboard` returns 200,
  login redirect gating works, `/api/auth/session` clean) as of the
  `@prisma/adapter-neon` + `engineType = "client"` fix — this took several
  deploy cycles to get right, see the Prisma bullet above for the two dead
  ends already ruled out.
- **Auth**: switched from Google OAuth to a Credentials (email/password)
  provider — see the architecture bullet above. No `AUTH_GOOGLE_*` env vars
  needed anywhere anymore.
